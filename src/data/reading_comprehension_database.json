      "passage": "When someone describes a kind person as \"having a heart of gold\", they are quoting from William Shakespeare's play Henry V. Encouraging someone to \"break the ice\" in an awkward social situation is borrowing from The Taming of the Shrew. The English language as we know it owes a great debt to the preeminent playwright, who introduced hundreds of previously unknown words and phrases into its lexicon. Shakespeare greatly enhanced the English language by altering existing words to create new ones. One type of manipulation involved combining two words to create a new term, for example, the word \"watchdog\" in reference to a person who tries to prevent wrong or illegal activity. Another strategy Shakespeare employed was using nouns as verbs. He was the first person to use \"friend\" as a verb, predating Facebook by almost 400 years. Shakespeare also anglicized words from foreign languages: for example the word \"critic\", which he derived from the Greek kritikos, meaning to judge or decide. He was also fond of adding prefixes and suffixes to existing words. According to James Shapiro of Columbia University, Shakespeare invented the words unaware, uncomfortable, uneducated, fashionable, and worthless, all of which are now deeply engrained in modern vernacular. Esteemed Shakespearean scholar David Crystal asserts that \"Shakespeare teaches us to dare to be creative, to push the rules a little bit. If the word isn't there, make one up.\" And indeed, the English language continues to evolve. In 2013, \"selfie\" was named the word of the year by the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, a choice Shakespeare would undoubtedly have approved of.",

      "passage": "According to researchers, habits account for about 40 percent of our behaviors on any given day. Understanding the nature of habits and learning how to form beneficial ones or change harmful ones is essential in life. For many people, however, creating new behavior patterns is an almost impossible task. The key to success lies in something called the habit loop. Put briefly, a habit loop consists of a cue, a routine and a reward. In his best-selling book The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg gives teeth brushing as an example. He explains that waking up in the morning with film on one's teeth is the cue that leads people to go through the routine of brushing their teeth, thereby yielding the reward of a clean and fresh feeling in their mouth. Research shows that it was the fresh taste of a new mint-flavored toothpaste called Pepsodent, in addition to the desire to remove the layer of plaque that gathers on teeth, that gave rise to the widespread practice of teeth brushing in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Customers claimed that they began looking forward to the cool and tingling sensation created by the toothpaste. The habit loop took hold and there was soon a soaring demand for Pepsodent and other mint-flavored toothpastes. In order to create a new habit or get rid of an old one it is necessary not just to identify a cue, a routine and a reward, but also to cultivate a craving that drives the loop. Duhigg explains that the reason people fail in their attempt to turn a new behavior into a set habit is that a one-time reward is not enough. Only when a behavior is repeated – and rewarded – a number of times does the brain begin anticipating the reward. Once the new routine has become automatic, a habit has been established.",

      "passage": "Medieval Italian scholar Leonardo Fibonacci (c. 1170-1240) ranks among the foremost mathematicians of all time. One of his most significant contributions to the field of mathematics was the dissemination of the Hindu-Arabic number system, based on the digits zero to nine (0-9), which is used all over the world today. Fibonacci first encountered Hindu-Arabic numerals when, as a child, he spent several years in North Africa with his family. Years later, he traveled widely in the Mediterranean world, delving further into the Hindu-Arabic number system and discovering its advantages over the Roman number system then in use in Europe. In 1202, after returning to his native Pisa, he published the Liber abaci (Book of Calculation), the first work to introduce Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe. Fibonacci's text demonstrated the usefulness of these numbers for practical, everyday arithmetic purposes such as money changing and the conversion of weights and measures. The book, which also discusses subjects such as geometry, algebra, and theoretical mathematics, drew the attention of leading scholars throughout Europe. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who was deeply interested in the arts and sciences, found the Liber abaci intriguing and asked to meet its author. For several years afterward, Fibonacci corresponded with the emperor and court scholars, exploring mathematical problems and their solutions. When Fibonacci published his most innovative work, the Liber quadratorum (Book of Square Numbers) in 1225, he dedicated it to the emperor. Although the Liber quadratorum was Fibonacci's most sophisticated achievement and constituted a major contribution to the field of mathematics, the Liber abaci is broader in scope and was ultimately a more influential work.",

      "passage": "Almost a century after his death, a new book by French author Jules Verne, Paris in the 20th Century, was published. The manuscript of this hitherto unknown novel was completed in 1863 but then locked away in a safe. It was discovered in 1989 by Verne's great-grandson and appeared in English translation only in 1996. This 19th-century vision of the future describes life among skyscrapers of glass and steel, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, calculators, fax machines, and a global communications network. Verne's remarkable ability to foresee technological advances and to describe them – even before their invention – is demonstrated in this novel, as in many of the works that made him famous, including Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and From the Earth to the Moon. However, this work counters the popular perception of Verne as an enthusiastic advocate of scientific progress. In fact, Paris in the 20th Century is a tragedy. It portrays the life of an idealistic young man who struggles unsuccessfully to find happiness in the fiercely materialistic world of the late 20th century. Verne's novel is a grim and troubling commentary on the high social costs of technological progress. Another common misconception about Verne is that he wrote about the wonders of technology because he was himself a scientist or an engineer. In truth, Verne was neither. The wealth of technical and scientific detail in Verne's fiction reflects his desire to depict – as persuasively as possible – the extraordinary power, as well as the far-reaching danger, of science and technology. Though he found science fascinating, he had no illusions that it was inherently virtuous.",

      "passage": "Millions of people suffer from Crohn's disease, colitis, and other gastrointestinal disorders. The gastrointestinal tract, which includes the stomach as well as the large and small intestines, is long, narrow, and winding. The limited accessibility of the tract, and particularly of the small intestine, sometimes makes it difficult, or even impossible, to use traditional diagnostic methods such as X-ray or ultrasound. Even endoscopy – a procedure in which a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera on its end is inserted into the gastrointestinal tract by way of the patient's mouth – cannot reach all parts of the small intestine. Capsule endoscopy, invented by Israeli engineer Gavriel Iddan, changed all that. Iddan revolutionized endoscopy by applying the principles of nanotechnology – the miniaturization of components – to the standard medical technique. His invention comprises a miniature camera, a battery, a light, and a wireless transmitter, all contained in a capsule the size of a large vitamin pill. The patient swallows the device, which then moves painlessly along the entire gastrointestinal tract, capturing images along the way. The tiny camera takes two color pictures every second for eight hours. These images are transmitted to a small, portable recording device and are later examined on a computer screen. Capsule endoscopy has made diagnosis possible in many hitherto unresolvable cases. Furthermore, it is less invasive than standard endoscopy and there is no discomfort involved. In fact, patients can even work or drive while undergoing the procedure. Gastroenterologists have discovered many additional applications for this technology. For example, different versions of the capsule can be used to administer drugs directly to an affected area or for other therapeutic purposes. Many physicians regard the device as a medical miracle.",

      "passage": "In 1897, British colonial forces invaded the Kingdom of Benin, located in what is now southern Nigeria. Within days, the British destroyed Benin City, bringing to an end a kingdom that had thrived for centuries as one of West Africa's major powers. In the course of their conquest, British troops looted at least 3,000 valuable objects, including statues, ceramics, masks, and over 1,000 intricately decorated plaques that adorned ancestral altars and court buildings in the city's royal palace. More than a century later, these artworks – now collectively known as the Benin Bronzes – are in the possession of over 150 museums, institutions, and private collections around the world. For many Nigerians today, the Benin Bronzes are a painful reminder of colonialism and its continued effects on African societies. For decades, Nigerian leaders and the country's Legacy Restoration Trust (LRT) have advocated for the artifacts' return. Nigerian-American artist Victor Ehikhamenor wrote an impassioned New York Times op-ed on the subject in 2020. His essay concluded: \"Generations of Africans have already lost incalculable history and cultural reference points because of the absence of some of the best artworks created on the continent. We shouldn't have to ask, over and over, to get back what is ours.\" As a result of his and other intense efforts to secure the restoration of the Benin Bronzes, several museums have declared their intention to relinquish the contested treasures. In July 2022, an agreement was signed between Germany and Nigeria, transferring ownership of over 1,100 Bronzes currently in German museums to Nigeria. Nevertheless, the path toward full repatriation of all the treasures remains protracted and complex, with many museums around the world refusing even to discuss the issue. A case in point is London's British Museum, which houses 900 looted Benin objects – the largest collection of any institution in the world. The museum has, however, historically resisted public requests for the works' restitution. There is perhaps a glimmer of hope (and admission of responsibility) in the 2021 statement issued by a British Museum spokeswoman acknowledging that the Bronzes were taken in circumstances of \"devastation and plunder\".",

It is often called wild carrot because it is related to the vegetable that we eat. In fact, if you rub and then sniff the plant's leaves, you will find that they smell like carrots. Queen Anne's lace has a circle of small, white flowers at the top of its long stem. Because of the way these tiny, delicate flowers are grouped together, they look like lace. There is a purple flower at the center of the cluster, making it seem as if a beetle is sitting there. No one is sure which Queen Anne the wildflower is named for. According to one story, it was named after the wife of King James I of England, who was originally from Denmark. When she came to England to marry the king, Anne saw wild carrot for the first time. She thought it so pretty that she decided to make lace that looked like the flower and sew it onto her dresses. Eventually, people began calling the plant by her name.",

      "passage": "One of the best ways to help the environment is also one of the simplest. Each year, the average family produces more than 350 kilograms of biodegradable waste – waste which can be broken down naturally into nutrients and used by other organisms. Usually, this \"green\" waste is hauled away along with other household garbage and buried in huge dumps and landfills. At best, these sites occupy valuable land and generate unpleasant odors; at worst, they create serious environmental hazards. Because buried biodegradable waste is not exposed to air, it rots, producing methane gas and acids which pollute the air, soil, and underground water sources. There is, however, a better way to deal with green waste. With very little effort, our eggshells, coffee grounds, and wilted lettuce leaves can be turned into wonderful fertilizer for our gardens and houseplants. Composting, turning green waste into fertilizer, dates back to ancient times. It requires no agronomic skill: anyone can learn how to compost in a matter of minutes. Biodegradable waste is placed in an open container, where it is kept damp and mixed regularly. The waste decomposes with the help of bacteria, earthworms, insects, and fungi. And because it is exposed to air – unlike waste buried in landfills – it does not rot. Composting has grown in popularity as people have become more environmentally aware. It not only creates a useful product, but also decreases the need for landfills, lessens reliance on chemical fertilizers, and reduces the number of garbage trucks polluting the air. Moreover, composting entails very little expense and can be done by individuals or groups of concerned citizens.",

      "passage": "The Latin phrase solvitur ambulando (\"it is solved by walking\") is often used when discussing the centuries-old belief that walking has a myriad of benefits. Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, was well known for his practice of thinking while strolling and would often teach while walking the grounds of his academy in Athens. Aristotle was aware of walking's contribution to health and importance for cognitive function. He was not the only prominent historical figure to adhere to the ethos of walking. Many writers and artists have been avid walkers, insisting that their walking routine was part of their creative process. The long nature walks favored by German composer Ludwig van Beethoven inspired many of his works, most notably his Pastoral Symphony. For English poet William Wordsworth, the act of walking was inseparable from the act of writing. He both wrote and revised lines of poetry while hiking, the rhythm of his steps influencing the rhythm of his works. And the American philosopher Henry David Thoreau was convinced that walking was indispensable for the well-being of both body and mind. He declared, \"I cannot preserve my health and spirits unless I spend four hours a day at least … sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields.\" Are the claims that walking enhances creativity purely speculative? Dr. Paul Sowden, a professor of psychology, has noted: \"Walking has been shown to improve our ability to shift between modes of thought and to improve our attention, memory, and recovery from mental fatigue, all of which are important for thinking creatively.\" Researchers Marily Oppezzo and Daniel Schwartz of Stanford University explored the purported link between walking and creativity. In one of their experiments, subjects were asked to brainstorm ideas under four different conditions: sitting indoors, walking on a treadmill indoors, being wheeled around outside in a wheelchair, and walking outdoors. The results, reported in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition in 2014, provided measurable evidence to support the notion of solvitur ambulando for anyone facing the challenge of generating new ideas.",

      "passage": "In all probability, residents of early medieval Europe enjoyed healthier conditions, despite the crudeness of sanitary equipment, than their more prosperous 16th-century descendants. This was due to the establishment, in the Middle Ages, of public bathhouses. Sometimes run by private individuals, but more often by the local municipality, these bathhouses were common institutions in medieval European towns. Their existence was an indication of the importance attached to cleanliness at the time. A visit to the public bathhouse involved both bathing and steaming. It was customary to engage in such extensive cleaning at least once in two weeks and sometimes even weekly. Like the Roman bathhouse, the medieval bathhouse was a meeting place which promoted social contact. Paintings of the period depict people gossiping and eating together at the bathhouse, unembarrassed by bodily exposure. In addition, at the bathhouse one could be treated for pains and inflammatory conditions. So popular was bathing in the Middle Ages that the practice even spread to rural districts. By the 16th century, however, bathing had become less popular throughout Europe. The city of Frankfurt, which had 29 bathhouse keepers in 1387, had none in 1530. The scarcity of wood in the vicinity of large cities had made heating large quantities of water prohibitively expensive. Bathing became a luxury that only the upper classes could afford. In the 19th century, in an attempt to overcome the uncleanliness and disorder that had prevailed in urban life for some time, many cities created public bathhouses in poor neighborhoods. No doubt those cities' officials would have been astounded to learn that they were returning to a common medieval practice.",

      "passage": "Jacques Cousteau was among the first underwater explorers to bring the wonders of the sea into homes around the globe. His books and films, and his television series, The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, introduced millions of people to the world of sharks, whales, dolphins, and other sea creatures. Though he was dedicated to sharing his excitement and curiosity through these media, Cousteau himself lived by the motto, \"We must go and see for ourselves.\" Born in France in 1910, Cousteau loved the ocean even as a child. As a young man, he joined the French navy, embarking on a life of adventure at sea. When he was in his thirties, he helped invent the aqualung, a machine that made it possible for people to breathe underwater for several hours at a time. In 1950, Cousteau bought the Calypso, the famed ship that took him on his explorations around the world. In the 1960s, he had the first of many undersea stations built, where teams of researchers could spend lengthy periods of time studying marine life and carrying out experiments. Cousteau's endeavors paved the way for future discoveries by marine biologists and underwater archaeologists. One of Cousteau's most important contributions was raising public awareness of the threat pollution poses to marine life. In 1960, together with Prince Rainier III of Monaco, he succeeded in preventing France from dumping nuclear waste in the Mediterranean Sea. He later founded the Cousteau Society for the Protection of Ocean Life. Cousteau died in 1997, but the society continues to educate the public about the need to conserve the oceans of the world.",

      "passage": "Science has interacted with the visual and performing arts for centuries, not only improving the preservation, reproduction, and dissemination of works of art, but also providing new, technology-based media for artistic expression. Despite concerns, there is no indication that science in any way compromises artistic creativity. On the contrary, it appears to nurture it by opening up new possibilities. The relationship between science and the culinary arts also has a long history; French physicist Denis Papin invented the pressure cooker in 1679 and described it in a book that can be considered the first modern text on science and cooking. Nevertheless, until the end of the twentieth century, scientists for the most part considered cooking to be a frivolous subject, while cooks regarded the introduction of scientific techniques into their kitchens with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Since the 1990s, however, interest in the application of science to the development of new cooking techniques has been mounting. Today, culinary science is a thriving field. Scientists study the chemical composition of foods, their physical and biological properties, and the interactions of their constituents with one another and with their environment. Physicists investigate the effects of heating and cooling processes on food, while structural chemists examine the behavior of large molecules, such as complex carbohydrates and proteins. Chromatographic technology makes it possible to isolate the components of foods that give rise to tastes and aromas. The gains of applying science to cooking are evident. Science can explain many old and seemingly inexplicable culinary tricks. It also allows chefs to experiment with new combinations of ingredients in their pursuit of sophisticated flavor profiles, beautiful presentation, and originality.",

There are tens of thousands of known orchid species, and botanists believe that there are thousands more that have not yet been identified. Orchids are lovely to look at and often have a pleasant smell. One of the best-known kinds of orchids is the vanilla plant, whose seeds are used in flavoring food and making perfume. Although orchids are often thought of as exotic, they are actually very common. They are found on every continent except Antarctica and in most environments – from deserts to tropical rainforests to mountaintops. Many orchids are epiphytes; they grow on the bark of trees. Other species, called lithophytes, grow on rock. Some orchids even grow completely underground. Taiwan – also called the Republic of China – grows more orchids for export than any other country in the world. Sales of the flowers bring in tens of millions of dollars there each year. But orchids are more than just a money maker for Taiwan. They have been an important part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. They are used in traditional Chinese medicines that strengthen the body's immune system, improve eyesight, and cure a number of illnesses. In Chinese art, the flower symbolizes human qualities such as modesty and honesty. Indeed, the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius compared virtuous people to orchids.",

      "passage": "For most of human history, the vast majority of people got plenty of exercise. The activities of daily life – hunting, plowing fields, chopping firewood, washing clothes by hand – demanded enough exertion to build strong muscles and healthy hearts and lungs. However, beginning in the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution changed the conditions of work and home. As technology continued to develop, physical activity declined steadily. Initially, this was hailed as freedom from toil and drudgery, but it was eventually recognized as a factor in the increased prevalence of certain health problems, such as heart disease. The physical culture movement, which emerged in Europe and North America in the 19th century, was an attempt to turn the tide. The movement advocated scheduled exercise and the introduction of physical education classes and organized sports into schools. Decades later in the early 1960s, U.S. President John F. Kennedy launched a nationwide campaign that challenged Americans of all ages to become physically fit. The second half of the 20th century saw the rise of fitness as a profitable industry. A myriad of companies began marketing sporting goods, exercise equipment, and memberships to gyms and exercise studios. Today, those interested in fitness can choose from a seemingly endless array of training and exercise methods. In addition, there is a growing body of scientific research on the effects of exercise and the best ways to keep fit. In spite of all this, more people than ever are out of shape, and medical conditions related to a sedentary lifestyle – such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure – are increasingly pervasive. Why is this so? For one thing, some people remain unaware of the need for exercise, or are simply uninterested. Even those who would like to exercise may not have the time. Long days of work, commuting, and family responsibilities leave a person tired. People often spend what little leisure time they have in front of screens large and small. Thus, despite the best efforts of the physical culture movement, it seems people are getting less exercise than their pre-Industrial Revolution counterparts.",

      "passage": "A Velocity of Being: Letters to a Young Reader (2018) is a collection of inspirational letters addressed to children about why we read and what books do for the human spirit. The letters are composed by 121 people, accomplished in fields ranging from astrophysics to philosophy and music. Reflecting an enormous range of human experiences, the writers – among whom are a Holocaust survivor and Italy's first woman in space – have one thing in common: their worldview has been shaped by a lifetime of reading. Rebecca Solnit, an eminent American writer and historian, contributed the following letter to the book: Dear Readers, Nearly every book has the same architecture – cover, spine, pages – but you open them onto worlds and gifts far beyond what paper and ink are, and on the inside they are every shape and power. Some books are toolkits you take up to fix things, from the most practical to the most mysterious, from your house to your heart, or to make things, from cakes to ships. Some books are wings. Some are horses that run away with you. Some are parties to which you are invited, full of friends who are there even when you have no friends. In some books you meet one remarkable person; in others a whole group or even a culture. Some books are medicine, bitter but clarifying. Some books are puzzles, mazes, tangles, jungles. Some long books are journeys, and at the end you are not the same person you were at the beginning. Some are handheld lights you can shine on almost anything. The books of my childhood were bricks, not for throwing but for building. I piled the books around me for protection and withdrew inside their battlements, building a tower in which I escaped my unhappy circumstances. There I lived for many years, in love with books, taking refuge in books, learning from books a strange data-rich out-of-date version of what it means to be human. Books gave me refuge. Or I built refuge out of them, out of these books that were both bricks and magical spells, protective spells I spun around myself. They can be doorways and ships and fortresses for anyone who loves them.",

      "passage": "There are quite a few localities in the world that have odd or amusing names. For example, there is a community called Hot Coffee in the US state of Mississippi, and a village called Great Snoring in Norfolk, England. There are even places named after a number. One of these is the town of Eighty Eight in the US state of Kentucky. Legend has it that this small farming community was named by its first postmaster, Dabnie Nunnally, in the 1860s. He recorded details of the incoming and outgoing mail and needed a name for the community. Because Nunnally wrote numbers more legibly than letters, he chose a name that could be expressed in numerals. He picked the name after counting the money in his pocket, which added up to 88 cents. There are those who say, however, that the name plays on the distance between the community and Glasgow, the seat of the local government, located 8.8 miles away. At some point, the town's name was officially changed to \"Eighty Eight\", spelled out in words, but residents still sometimes receive mail bearing the address \"88, Kentucky\". For the most part, this tiny town has remained out of the spotlight, but it did enjoy a brief moment of fame in 1948. In the presidential election of that year, 88 votes were cast for President Harry Truman and 88 votes for his opponent Thomas Dewey. This remarkable coincidence was reported in Ripley's Believe It or Not!, a publication devoted to unusual and bizarre occurrences. Not surprisingly, the year 1988 also saw a major surge of interest in Eighty Eight. The New York Times reported that people from around the globe were sending letters along with self-addressed envelopes to the town's postmistress, requesting that she mail back the envelopes, which would be postmarked \"Eighty Eight\" and \"1988\". Such was the volume of mail that the postmistress was sending that she had to retire her old inkpad and stamp and have an efficient postmarking device installed. An especially popular request was that the envelopes be put aside and mailed on 8/8/88. The town of Eighty Eight will presumably be back in the news in 2088 – if people are still mailing letters, that is.",

      "passage": "The Hunza Valley, nestled in the heart of the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan, is home to a small ethnic group: the Burusho people, also known as the Hunzakut. Until the Karakoram Highway was opened in 1978, the valley was one of the most remote regions in the world. The Burusho people's prolonged isolation may explain why their language, Burushaski, appears unrelated to any other language in the world. Travelers to the region have brought back tales of the remarkable longevity enjoyed by the Burusho, claiming that they commonly live past the age of 100. Such claims are impossible to verify because Burushaski had no written form until relatively recently and so no relevant documents exist. Lifespan aside, observers are struck by the people's extraordinary good health. Irrespective of age, they seem to be exceptionally fit and disease-free. This is all the more remarkable considering that the Burusho have very little access to even basic modern health care. A number of factors may contribute to the unusual vitality of the Burusho. For one thing, they walk the hilly terrain every day. Another factor is their diet, which consists mainly of naturally grown grains, fruits, and vegetables. This diet is dictated mostly by their environment. Pastureland is scarce, so there is little meat or milk, but many crops flourish in the valley's fertile soil. A surprising staple food that has been highlighted as a major contributor to the robust health of the Burusho is the apricot. This succulent fruit, rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, has been consumed in enormous quantities for generations. The fruit is eaten year round – fresh in the summer and dried in the winter. Bataring daudo, or apricot soup, is a mainstay of the Burusho diet. This hearty soup has helped the Burusho endure many a frigid winter. To make it, dried apricots are boiled until soft. Next, wheat flour is mixed with water to create noodle-like nuggets of dough. Added to the simmering apricots, they transform the mixture into a nourishing dumpling soup. Less of a delicacy and more of a strategy to get through lean seasons with scant resources, bataring daudo speaks of Burusho self-sufficiency and resilience.",

      "passage": "In 1519, an expedition led by Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés arrived in the New World. There, in the marketplaces of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire and the site of present-day Mexico City, the Spaniards caught a glimpse of cloth dyed a vibrant red color, the likes of which had never been seen in Europe. Upon investigation, they learned that the crimson hue, called cochineal, was derived from the insect of the same name, which was used to create paints, dyes and even medicines. In Europe at the time, deep reds were elusive. Only a few natural substances produced red dyes and those tended to fade when exposed to heat and light. When Cortés reported his discovery to King Charles V of Spain, the monarch immediately recognized cochineal's commercial value. The Spanish began studying the Aztecs' technique for extracting dye from cochineals and shipped tons of dried insects back to Europe. The shade they yielded was deemed the \"perfect red\" and became a sensation. By the 1570s, the pigment had become a highly lucrative commodity, coveted by artists as well as the upper classes, who viewed it as a luxury and a symbol of status. To ensure that it remained the sole supplier of the dye, the Spanish monarchy made it a punishable offense to take cochineal out of Spain or its colonies without authorization. Spain also concealed information about the origins of cochineal so that, for years, few Europeans were aware that the dye came from an insect. Over the centuries, countries went to great lengths to uncover the secret. In 1776, French botanist Nicolas-Joseph Thiéry de Menonville sailed to North America with the aim of stealing live specimens of cochineal. He managed to smuggle some insects, as well as the prickly pear cactuses upon which they feed, to the nearby French colony of Saint- Dominique. Thiéry, however, died before he could free France from its dependence on Spain for cochineal. In the early 19th century, Spain lost its exclusive control of the cochineal industry. As more countries began manufacturing the dye, its price fell. Moreover, demand for cochineal was diminished at that time by the advent of synthetic dyes which, though more affected by heat and light, were much cheaper and easier to produce. Still, cochineal continued to be used, particularly in the food and cosmetic industries. Today, the insect is farmed mainly in Peru, which holds a 95% share of the international market.",
